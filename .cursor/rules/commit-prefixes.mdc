# Commit Message Prefixes

Every commit must use a prefix that reflects the type of change. Choose one and put it at the start of the commit message, followed by a colon and space, then the short description.

## Prefixes

| Prefix | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `feature` | New functionality, new endpoint, new UI block, new field/API |
| `bug-fix` | Fixing incorrect behavior, login/API errors, wrong display |
| `fix` | Same as bug-fix; prefer `bug-fix` for user-facing bugs |
| `refactor` | Restructure code without changing behavior |
| `chore` | Tooling, deps, config, migrations, no user-facing change |
| `docs` | Only documentation or comments |
| `style` | Only formatting, CSS, no logic change |
| `feature improvements` | Improving existing feature (UX, copy, layout, validation) |

## Examples

- `feature: add next_tier_progress_percent to profile API`
- `bug-fix: login failed despite 200 response`
- `feature improvements: reduce recommendations section top padding`
- `chore: remove level-card and related DOM refs`
- `refactor: move CRS pill to Driver identity`

When the user asks to commit/push, choose the prefix from the change set (new stuff → feature; fix → bug-fix; removal/cleanup → chore or refactor; tweaks → feature improvements) and use it in the commit message.
