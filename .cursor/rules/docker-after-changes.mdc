# Docker after code changes

After making any change to the codebase in this project, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Run this from the project root (where `docker-compose.yml` lives).
- Use PowerShell: `Set-Location "path\to\RacerPath"; docker compose up -d --build`
- This rebuilds images and starts/restarts containers so changes are reflected.
