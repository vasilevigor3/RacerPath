# Frontend & Backend implementation guidelines

**Always read this rule before implementing any code.**

---

## 1. Frontend

When implementing or changing anything on the **frontend**:

- Be guided by **classy, modern solutions** (UI/UX quality, clarity, consistency).
- When in doubt or when designing new UI, **check current UI/UX trends** (e.g. via web search: "UI UX trends [year]", "best practices [component type]", "accessibility patterns").
- Prefer: clear hierarchy, readable typography, sensible spacing, accessible patterns (focus, labels, ARIA where needed), responsive behavior, and a cohesive visual language with the rest of the app.

---

## 2. Backend

When implementing or changing anything on the **backend**:

- Be guided by a **modern, proven stack** and established best practices for the tech in use (e.g. FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic in this project).
- Prefer: clear layering (routes → services/repositories → models), validation at boundaries, consistent error handling, and patterns that are widely used and maintainable in the ecosystem.
